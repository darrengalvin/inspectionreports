# Supported Housing Inspection Platform
## Project Proposal

---

**Prepared for:** [Client Name]  
**Prepared by:** [Your Name]  
**Date:** January 2026

---

## The Challenge

You need a system to conduct quality inspections across your supported housing properties — capturing resident feedback, generating professional reports, and tracking improvements over time.

The typical approach would be to build a rigid app with hardcoded questions that requires a developer every time you want to change wording, add a new section, or adapt to regulatory changes.

**That's not what I'm proposing.**

---

## My Approach: Content-First Architecture

Instead of building an app with fixed questions, I'm building a **platform** with configurable question formats.

### What this means:

| Traditional Approach | My Approach |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Questions hardcoded into the app | Questions stored as data (editable) |
| Change a question = developer time | Change a question = edit a form |
| One question type fits all | 14 different input formats per question |
| Expensive to modify | Modify anytime, no code changes |

### The Question Format Library

Every question can use the right input type for the data you need:

**Quantitative**
- Slider (1-10 scale)
- Star rating (1-5)
- Number input
- Multi-dimension ratings

**Single Choice**
- Dropdown select
- Radio buttons
- Yes/No toggle
- Segmented control
- Likert scale (agree/disagree)

**Free Form**
- Short text
- Long text (notes)
- Quote capture with sentiment tagging
- Multi-select checkboxes

You decide which format each question uses. The platform renders it correctly and captures the data appropriately.

## What You Get

### 1. Inspection Web App
- Works on tablet, phone, or laptop
- Offline-capable (complete inspections without internet)
- Progress saving (resume where you left off)
- Guided flow through all 15 inspection sections

### 2. Report Generator
- Professional PDF reports from collected data
- Evidence-based scoring (every score shows why)
- Direct resident quotes with sentiment tagging
- Action items with priority and deadlines
- Clean, non-"AI looking" design

### 3. Admin Dashboard
- Edit questions without developer involvement
- Add/remove sections as regulations change
- View all inspections across properties
- Track action items and follow-ups

### 4. Handover & Documentation
- Full walkthrough of how to use the system
- Documentation for editing questions
- Source code access (you own it)

## Investment

### Project Fee: £5,000

Structured as 2 units @ £2,500 each:

**Unit 1 — Foundation (£2,500)**
- Core inspection app with all 15 sections
- Question format system (all 14 input types)
- Data storage and user authentication
- Basic report generation

**Unit 2 — Polish & Handover (£2,500)**
- Professional PDF report design
- Admin dashboard for editing questions
- Offline capability
- Handover session + documentation
- 30 days post-launch support

### Payment Schedule
- 50% (£2,500) on project start
- 50% (£2,500) on completion

## Ongoing Costs

These are third-party services I recommend. You pay them directly.

| Service | Purpose | Estimated Cost |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| Vercel | Hosting the web app | £0–20/month* |
| Supabase | Database & authentication | £0–25/month* |
| **Total** | | **£0–45/month** |

*Free tiers available — costs only apply at scale (many users, many inspections)

You're not locked in to me for hosting. Standard technologies mean any developer can maintain this.

---

## Timeline

| Week | Deliverable |
|------|-------------|
| 1 | Core app structure, question system, first 5 sections |
| 2 | Remaining sections, data storage, authentication |
| 3 | Report generation, PDF export |
| 4 | Admin dashboard, testing, handover |

**Total: 4 weeks from start to launch**

---

## Why Me

1. **I understand the domain** — I've already mapped out all 15 inspection areas, 60+ questions, and probing follow-ups based on real inspection frameworks.

2. **I build for change** — Regulations change. Your needs evolve. The architecture I'm proposing means you're not stuck with v1 forever.

3. **No lock-in** — You own the code. Standard tech stack (Next.js, TypeScript, Supabase). Any developer can pick it up.

4. **I've already started** — I have working prototypes of the question formats and report design. This isn't theoretical.

## Next Steps

1. Review this proposal
2. 30-minute call to discuss any questions
3. If we proceed: contract + deposit → project begins
